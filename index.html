        <p>Krishnakumar Kunnath or K.K. (as he is popularly known as) was born on August 23, 1968. This Delhi-based
            singer came to Mumbai in 1994 in search for his career and finally, he got a call to sing a one-minute jingle 
            for singer Leslie Lewis for UTV which kick started his career. He started singing and the age of two and was
